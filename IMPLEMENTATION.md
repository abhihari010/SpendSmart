# Implementation

As required in the spec for PM4 at https://github.com/CS3704-VT/Course/blob/main/Project/PM4.md,
we are including a IMPLEMENTATION.md file that explains the following:

* What feature you implemented
* An explanation of what the generated code does and if it does what you were expecting
* What AI tools were used, how, and why.
* Explain if any modifications were needed to the prompts/codes to get to the output.

## Alexander Peal

* I implemented the goals feature.
* The generated code does not work. This matches my expectations, as our project is a skeleton and
doesn't support data persistence (i.e. we don't have a database set up yet.)
* I used Cursor, an AI-powered IDE, to work on this section. Sonnet 4.5 is the LLM I used with Cursor
to help me understand the repository and generate the multiple functions required for this part of the assignment.
* The given prompts were sufficient for getting to the output. I didn't think any modifications were needed to get skeleton code I was satisfied with.
* For the next milestone, we'll use the black box test plan to get the goals feature closer to a functional state.
